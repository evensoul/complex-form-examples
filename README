Complex Form Examples - 2 level nesting
----------------------------------------

Example of nested forms with 2 level nesting.

- We've extracted html chunks into javascript variables in the head to avoid repetition and double javascript escaping (escape_javascript).
- Events work with delegate because it's easier when adding dynamic html parts.
- Most of the javascript is extracted to application.js

Javascript logic
----------------

LEVEL 1
-------

<a class="add_nested_item" rel="tasks" href="#task">Add a task</a>

class - Event attachment
rel   - id of element in which we append new sub elements
href  - variable name of the template which are generated in <head> 


LEVEL 2
-------
<a rel="[task][colors]" class="add_nested_item_lvl2" href="#color">Add a color</a>

rel   - css class names parent element, group element in which we append new sub elements
